\section{Methodology}
The simulation is conducted through Simulink, as depicted in Fig~\ref{fig:heat_system_diagram} the heating or control temperature system. This system comprises four primary components: the heating system, the $P_{0}$ computation, the $x_{0}$ calculation, and the least-squares filter implemented as a Matlab function.

The heating system is responsible for replicating the temperature variation, using an ambient temperature of 25$^{\circ}$C as a reference. Initially, the simulation begins with a transition from 0$^{\circ}$C to 25$^{\circ}$C. Subsequently, the heating system activates, initiating a temperature alteration over a 150-second interval. Following this, the system deactivates and the simulation runs for an additional 150-second period. \\

The component that computes $P_{0}$ uses the Eq~\ref{eq:lse_recursion_P0}. The following Matlab code shows its implementation:

\lstinputlisting[language=Octave]{codes/compute_p0.m}

In the other hand, Eq~\ref{eq:lse_recursion_x0} is used to compute the value of $x_{0}$ and the implemented code is shown:

\lstinputlisting[language=Octave]{codes/compute_x0.m}

Finally, the least-squares estimation using the covariance recursion form based on Eq~\ref{eq:lse_recursion} is implemented as shown below:

\lstinputlisting[language=Octave]{codes/compute_pk1.m}

For the simulation, the following parameters are used:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\tau$: the time constant of the system is set to 20s.

    \item $K_{p}$: the gain of the system is set to 0.5.

    \item $\sigma$: the standard deviation of the Gaussian white noise is set to 0.008.

    \item $\alpha$: is set to $10^{3}$

    \item $\beta$: is vector set to $\left[ 0.01 ~ 0.01 \right]$.

    \item $\Delta t$: the sampling time is set to 0.1 seconds.
\end{itemize}

and the code used is shown, as well as the computation of the parameters $a$, $b$, and $W$:

\lstinputlisting[language=Octave]{codes/constants.m}

where:

\begin{equation}
    a = \frac{-1}{\tau} = \frac{-1}{20} = -0.05
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    b = \frac{K_{p}}{\tau} = \frac{0.5}{20} = 0.025
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    W = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2}} = \frac{1}{0.08^{2}} = 156.25
\end{equation}

The system predicts the parameters $\phi$ and $\Gamma$ which can be computed using the Eq~\ref{eq:phi} and~\ref{eq:gamma}:

\begin{equation}
    \phi(k) = e^{a \cdot \Delta t} = e^{-0.05 \cdot 0.1} = 0.9950
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \Gamma(k) = \frac{0.025}{-0.05} \left( e^{-0.05 \cdot 0.1} - 1\right) = 0.0025
\end{equation}
