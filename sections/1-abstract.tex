Accurate temperature monitoring is crucial in numerous daily and industrial applications. To address this, the utilization of a least-squares filter to effectively mitigate noise in the measured variable is explored in this paper.

For the study, a heating system was simulated using Simulink, incorporating Gaussian white noise into the output to mirror real-world disturbances. The system maintains a set-point of 25$^\circ$C, which represents the ambient temperature, and features an input pulse that activates the heating mechanism.

The findings indicate that the least-squares estimation technique successfully approximates the actual temperature with a high degree of accuracy, achieving results that closely match the true values.
