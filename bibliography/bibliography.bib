  abstract = {This review presents an overview of the different techniques developed over the last decade to regulate the temperature within microfluidic systems. A variety of different approaches has been adopted, from external heating sources to Joule heating, microwaves or the use of lasers to cite just a few examples. The scope of the technical solutions developed to date is impressive and encompasses for instance temperature ramp rates ranging from 0.1 to 2,000 °C/s leading to homogeneous temperatures from −3 °C to 120 °C, and constant gradients from 6 to 40 °C/mm with a fair degree of accuracy. We also examine some recent strategies developed for applications such as digital microfluidics, where integration of a heating source to generate a temperature gradient offers control of a key parameter, without necessarily requiring great accuracy. Conversely, Temperature Gradient Focusing requires high accuracy in order to control both the concentration and separation of charged species. In addition, the Polymerase Chain Reaction requires both accuracy (homogeneous temperature) and integration to carry out demanding heating cycles. The spectrum of applications requiring temperature regulation is growing rapidly with increasingly important implications for the physical, chemical and biotechnological sectors, depending on the relevant heating technique.},

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary
               This chapter discusses the specific synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in vitro through the medium of a polymerase-catalyzed chain reaction. A method whereby a nucleic acid sequence can be exponentially amplified in vitro is described in the chapter. The same method can be used to alter the amplified sequence or to append new sequence information to it. It is necessary that the ends of the sequence be known in sufficient detail that oligonucleotides can be synthesized, which will hybridize to them and that a small amount of the sequence be available to initiate the reaction. The oligonucleotides are complementary to different strands of the desired sequence and at relative positions along the sequence such that the DNA polymerase extension product of the one, when denatured, can serve as a template for the other and vice versa. Oligonucleotides were synthesized using an automated DNA synthesis machine (Biosearch, Inc., San Rafael, California) using phosphoramidite chemistry. “Mispriming"” can be usefully employed to make intentional in vitro mutations or to add sequence information to one or both ends of a given sequence. The chapter explores the possibility of utilizing a heat-stable DNA polymerase so as to avoid the need for addition of new enzyme after each cycle of thermal denaturation}

  abstract = {A thermostable DNA polymerase was used in an in vitro DNA amplification procedure, the polymerase chain reaction. The enzyme, isolated from Thermus aquaticus, greatly simplifies the procedure and, by enabling the amplification reaction to be performed at higher temperatures, significantly improves the specificity, yield, sensitivity, and length of products that can be amplified. Single-copy genomic sequences were amplified by a factor of more than 10 million with very high specificity, and DNA segments up to 2000 base pairs were readily amplified. In addition, the method was used to amplify and detect a target DNA molecule present only once in a sample of 105 cells.}

  abstract  = {The development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has often been likened to the development of the Internet, and although this does risk overstating the impact of PCR outside the scientific community, the comparison works well on a number of levels. Both inventions have emerged in the last 20 years to the point where it is difficult to imagine life without them. Both have grown far beyond the confines of their original simple design and have created opportunities unimaginable before their invention. Both have also spawned a whole new vocabulary and professionals literate in that vocabulary. It is hard to believe that the technique that formed the cornerstone of the human genome project and is fundamental to many molecular biology laboratory protocols was discovered only 20 years ago. For many, the history and some of the enduring controversies are unknown yet, as with the discovery of the structure of DNA in the 1950s, the discovery of PCR is the subject of claim and counterclaim that has yet to be fully resolved. The key stages are reviewed here in brief for those for whom both the history and application of science holds interest.},

At a template concentration as low as 10 E. coli cells (equivalent to 50 fg genomic DNA){,} a K12-specific gene product (221 bp) was adequately amplified with a total of 30 cycles in 30 min. Sensitivity of the PCR micro reactor was demonstrated with its ability to amplify K12-specific gene from 10 cells in the presence of 2% blood. Specificity of the polycarbonate PCR micro reactor was also proven through multiplex PCR and/or amplification of different pathogen-specific genes. This is{,} to our knowledge{,} the first systematic study of assay sensitivity and specificity performed in plastic{,} disposable micro PCR devices.}

However, it is not sufficient to optimize the thermal behavior of each subsystem, but thermal management has to be considered at system level to optimize the global performance of the vehicle. The present paper provides an organic review of the current aspects of thermal management from a system engineering perspective. Starting from the definition of the requirements and targets of the thermal management system, each vehicle subsystem is analyzed and related to the whole system. In this framework, problems referring to modeling, simulation and optimization are considered and discussed. The current technological challenges and developments in thermal management are highlighted at vehicle and component levels.},
